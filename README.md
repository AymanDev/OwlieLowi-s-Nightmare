### Description
Simple infinite type of game. Just run around collect items which gives buffs, heals and add points. Task is to collect points and go on another round of collecting points. Game was made for fun on my vacation so it is not best executed. There is so much i have planned to add to this game, but first i decied to try port game on Bevy with Rust. This will help me understand that language more and achieve multiplatform without additional wrappers around my game.
